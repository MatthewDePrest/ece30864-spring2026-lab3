1. Some pro's of the agile method that it is a iterative approach allowing for a streamlined way to do work.
It works to break the project down into multiple different parts and allows for constant interaction and collaboration with the customer. The cons of the agile method is that with agile it doesn't 
always break down the project into smaller sprints where smaller parts can be worked on continously. This can mean that the timeline is harder to know since the scope of the project can be really big and doing big parts of it at once can be problematic.
